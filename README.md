PinewoodDerby
=============

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/nilbus/pinewood-derby.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/nilbus/pinewood-derby)

A web-based race manager and status board application for the Cub Scout [pinewood derby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinewood_derby)

Features
--------

* Show a status board (TV/projector) with the standings, most recent heat times, and upcoming heats, all updated in real-time
* Register contestants, even after the derby has begun
* Activate the start switch for each race with a button in the app
* Swap out contestants in upcoming heats when someone is MIA or not ready to race
* Redo the most recent heat when something goes wrong
* Manage the derby, show the display board, and run the sensor on different devices if desired
* Retire contestants that drop out of the derby
* The welcome screen displays the URL at which other devices can access the application
* Warnings are displayed when the USB device is unplugged or the sensor daemon is not running
* Lineup order is automatically generated (using the rules below)
* Race using a configurable number of lanes

### Derby lineup rules

* Each contestant will run exactly once in each lane
* The winner is the contestant with the lowest cumulative/average time (no brackets/playoffs)
* In the first round, contestants race in the order they were registered
* Contestants will race against others they have not yet raced against when possible
* Keeping the above constraints, racers with slower averages will race before those with faster averages
* When swapping out or adding contestants, the upcoming 3 heats are not recalculated unless there are empty lanes

### Missing features

* Manual lineup - Races are lined up using the rules above and cannot yet be manually set
* Authentication - anyone who visits the app URL can start races, modify contestants, clear all data, etc.
* Customization - support for other devices and variations on the lineup rules
* Deltas - indicate when a contestant moves up or down in rank with a green or red highlight
* Canceling a heat - once you start a heat, you cannot cancel it and must trigger the sensor
* Non-finishers - handle people whose cars don't make it to the sensor in under 10 seconds; currently they don't get a time for that heat
* Windows support - The application runs only on Linux and Mac OSX
* Mobile layout - the responsive mobile layout sometimes isn't very pretty

Feel free to inquire (via issues) regarding how you can modify this app for your setup. I am happy to assist.

Supported Track Sensors
-----------------------

* [MicroWizard FastTrack K3](http://microwizard.com/k3page.html)
* [NewBold DT8000](http://www.pinewood-derby-timer.com/DT8000.html)

Adding support for any track sensor that communicates via serial port should be straightforward.

Initial Setup
-------------

1. [Install drivers for the USB serial connector](https://github.com/nilbus/pinewood-derby/wiki/USB-serial-driver-installation)
1. Install [Ruby &gt;= 1.9.2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads), [bundler](http://bundler.io), [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), and [Redis](http://redis.io)
1. Install the required ruby dependencies

        bundle install

1. Copy and configure `config/database.yml.example` to `config/database.yml`
1. After starting the PostgreSQL server, initialize the database

        rake db:setup RAILS_ENV=development
        rake db:setup RAILS_ENV=production

1. Ensure the `config/derby_config.yaml` file is configured correctly for your setup
1. Precompile assets for production mode (Do this every time you update javascript/css/images)

        rake asset:precompile RAILS_ENV=production

Starting the Derby
------------------

1. Run the application and sensor daemon as root (for access to port 80) and wait a few seconds

        sudo foreman start   # or rvmsudo if using rvm

1. Visit http://localhost/ - You should see the welcome screen, and it should report that the sensor is not plugged in
1. Connect the sensor via USB, and turn it on. (DT-8000: Hit the reset button, and it should display "3 lanes". Press reset until the sensor display goes blank.)
1. Verify that the "not plugged in" warning has gone away
1. Connect with other devices to the URL on the welcome page (status board and/or other device to manage the derby)
1. Visit the contestants page to register contestants
1. Visit the Dashboard page to manage the races

Running a heat
--------------

1. Have the contestants for the upcoming heat place their cars on the track. If a contestant is missing, click their name to swap in another contestant and try the missing person later.
2. On the Dashboard page, click the "Start the race" button. The next race is highlighted in green.
3. Simultaneously release the cars and release the sensor's start switch to start the timer. The race times will appear on the Dashboard after they pass the finish line.
4. If needed, click the "redo" button to re-run the same heat.

Testing
-------

To simulate a track sensor when one is not plugged in, use the mock sensor:

    bin/mock-sensor

mock-sensor will announce what device file (ie. `/dev/ttys009`) it is using.

Before staring the server/daemon, set the environment variable `TRACK_SENSOR_DEVICE` to this device file. Eg:

In production:

    export TRACK_SENSOR_DEVICE=/dev/ttys009
    sudo -E foreman start

In development:

    TRACK_SENSOR_DEVICE=/dev/ttys009 rake daemon:sensor_watch

Configuration
=============

`config/derby_config.yml` contains several configuration options, including sensor type, device file location, and lane count.

Developing
==========

This project uses Rails 4.

In production, use `foreman` to start the app server and sensor\_watch daeon togehter using foreman.

In development, start the app server and daemon separately in different terminals:

    rails server

    rake daemon:sensor_watch

Architecture
------------

### Sensor driver

`TrackSensor` drivers in lib/track\_sensor/\* communicate with the sensor device via the device file in /dev. It tells the device to start a race and reads the race times. When the device is unplugged, it throws an error when attempting to read race times.

This component could be separated into its own gem, but I'm including it in this project for now.

### SensorWatch daemon

`SensorWatch` runs as a daemon to keep the persistent instance of TrackSensor necessary to keep the device open. The application communicates with the daemon via POSIX signals (SIGUSR1) to start a race. The daemon communicates with the app via Faye and database updates.

### Rails web server

The user interface is provided via the web.

### Faye websocket pub/sub

The faye-rails `AnnounceController` in the `SensorWatch` daemon uses ActiveRecord observers to detect changes the daemon makes to the models - updating heat status, run times, etc. These changes trigger Faye to publish a message.

The faye-redis engine communicates these update messages to the Faye publisher running in the app server.
This publisher sends the `Dashboard` json updates to its javascript clients connected via websockets.
